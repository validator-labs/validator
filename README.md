# validator
validator (AKA Validation Controller) monitors ValidationResults created by one or more validator plugins and uploads them to a sink of your choosing, e.g., Slack or Spectro Cloud Palette.

## Description
The validator repository is fairly minimal - all the heavy lifting is done by the validator plugins. Installation of validator and one or more plugins is accomplished via Helm.

Plugins:
- [AWS](https://github.com/spectrocloud-labs/validator-plugin-aws)
- [Network](https://github.com/spectrocloud-labs/validator-plugin-network)
- [vSphere](https://github.com/spectrocloud-labs/validator-plugin-vsphere)

## Installation
```bash
helm repo add validator https://spectrocloud-labs.github.io/validator/
helm repo update
helm install validator validator/validator -n validator --create-namespace
```

## Getting Started
You’ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/validator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/validator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
All contributions are welcome! Feel free to reach out on the [Spectro Cloud community Slack](https://spectrocloudcommunity.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-g8gfzrhf-cKavsGD_myOh30K24pImLA#/shared-invite/email).

Make sure `pre-commit` is [installed](https://pre-commit.com#install).

Install the `pre-commit` scripts:

```console
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
